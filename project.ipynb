    "# Labs 7 & 8: The wider python ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time, we've had a deep look at Python's OOP paradigm. With that, we have covered most of the basics: the toolbox at your disposal should be enough to tackle most issues you'll encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, basics are just that: basics. Learning more about the python ecosystem will help you be more efficient. Knowing what exists in third-party libraries will help you not reinvent the wheel for well-trodden problems. We'll be giving you pointers to existing libraries to get you started, as well as explore the functional programming style.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second goal is to familiarize you with good practices when working with python scripts. We'll be covering TDD (test-driven development), as well as debugging using `pdb`, and python code modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet these two goals, we'll focus on a **project**: implementing a small classification script to distinguish apes species based on features such as weight, height, fur color... To be precise, you will workw with multiple python scripts:\n",
    "1. `monkey_classif.py`, which will be responsible for running our classification algorithm\n",
    "2. `monkey_visualize.py`, which will contain all the logic for producing visualizations\n",
    "3. `monkey_model.py`, which will contain all the object-oriented logic for constructing our monkey representations\n",
    "4. `utils.py`, which will contain all the utility functions and \"glue code\"\n",
    "5. `tests.py`, which will correspond to tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**: the csv file that you will need is called `monkeys.csv`, which contains 3K lines of 3 types of monkeys. Roughly 25% of the datapoints are missing labels, and about 1% of the data per column is malformed, meaning missing value. You will need to download the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook is mostly here as an instructions file, as well as a convenient place for us to put reviews and such. It's structured as follows:\n",
    "1. Part #1 gives the precise instructions as to what you need to implement\n",
    "2. Part #2 contains information about how to debug and write test cases. It also contains a bunch of additional exercises to make sure you understand the concepts we're presenting here. This part teaches you the best practices to python project development.\n",
    "3. Part #3 gives you pointers on functionnal programming.\n",
    "4. Part #4 gives you pointers to the standard libraries used for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** *Make sure everything runs smoothly and without error before submitting your work!*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we'll expect a **different format of submission**: you'll have to submit all your source files in a ZIP archive file. We expect the submission to be named `td8_firstname_lastname.zip`, with `firstname` your first name and `lastname` your last name (e.g. Jane Doe's submission should be called `td8_jane_doe.zip`). The archive must contain _everything needed to run your code_, and _only that_. You should **submit before TBD**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** This is a *megalab* - you will have the last two lab sessions of the course to work on it and the grade for this lab will be counted twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate your submission, we will be looking at the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does your code run? (So **run** your program at least once before submitting!)\n",
    "- Does it run correctly? (So **test** your solution with a few different inputs!)\n",
    "- Is your code well-commented?\n",
    "- Is your code well-structured?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this lab is to confront you to an actual python project. It might seem overwhelming at first! Break down the full process into little steps, and you'll see that it's actually not so big of a deal. Start by reading this instruction notebook in its entirety!\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what we'll evaluate in this lab is your ability to produce clean, coherent, consistent, commented code. If you have the time, try to make your code as efficient as possible. Feel free to add supplementary files, functions and functionalities."

    "### Exercise #1: Implement a `Monkey` class and unit tests for it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your file `monkey_model.py`, declare a class named `Monkey`. `Monkey` objects are to have four attributes: `species`, `fur_color`, `size`, `weight`. The `species` should default to an empty string, passing a value to the constructor for the three other attributes is mandatory. The `fur_color` will be represented as a hexadecimal color value string.\n",
    "2. Add `__str__` and `__repr__` methods to make things more readable. Both methods should return `str` containing information on all four attribtues of the `Monkey` object. The expected output for a monkey of species Gorilla, with weight 42kg, size 37 sm and fur color #123456 is: `\"Monkey (Gorilla), 42kg, 37cm, fur: #123456\"`\n",
    "3. In your file `utils.py`, you will find a function called `check_hexacolor(color_str)` that verifies whether a string is a valid hexadecimal color code. In short, a string representing a color starting with a hashtag `#`, followed by six hexadecimal integers. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_hex.asp) for details.\n",
    "4. Import the function `check_hexacolor` in your file `monkey_model.py`. Modify your `Monkey` class constructor: raise a ValueError if the value provided for `fur_string` is not a hexadecimal color string.\n",
    "5. We have already provided tests for many of the functions in this project in `tests.py` and written the `__init__` functions of the test class for the `Monkey` class. You task is for this part is to implement a number of tests for the `Monkey` class:\n",
    "    1. `test_constructor()` to test whether the constructor of the `Monkey` class is working correctly\n",
    "    1. `test_str()` to test the `__str__` and `__repr__` functions\n",
    "    1. `test_check_fur()` to test that `check_hexacolor()` is correctly applied"

    "1. In your class `Monkey`, add a method `compute_bmi` that returns the body mass index of a monkey. As a reminder, the BMI is defined as: $$BMI = \\frac{weight}{size^2}$$\n",
    "2. In your file `monkey_classif.py`, implement the function `read_monkeys_from_csv(csv_path, strict)` that loads the CSV file `monkeys.csv` using the pandas library. **Read Part #4 carefully beforehand!**.\n",

    "### Review #1.1: The KNN algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN stands for `k nearest neighbors`. It is a rather straightforward classification algorithm, where items are assigned labels based on the most common label of their `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN presupposes a distance function between all items (Monkeys, in our case). In practice, this means that we need to be able to convert any item into a point in an Euclidean space with $d$ dimensions. Once we have that, we can use the standard euclidean distance between two points to determine which already classified items are the nearest neighbors of the current item to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode for a simple KNN classification is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for each unlabelled item I; do\n",
    "    for each labelled item J; do \n",
    "        compute the distance between I and J\n",
    "    neighbors <- select the k items J with minimal distance to I\n",
    "    label for I <- select the most common label for the neighbors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variants of the algorithm may or may not append the classified item `I` to the set of labelled items. Doing so may have consequences in terms of stability, depending on the distribution of the data and the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point where the algorithm may vary consists in how to select the label once the neighbors have been computed. In the standard approach, a simple \"plurality vote\" among neighbors is used to determine the label. In other approaches, the relative importance of each neighbor's label may be weighted by the inverse of its distance to `I`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise #3: Implement a Monkey classification KNN function\n",
    "\n",
    "The third exercise consists in implementing a KNN classification algorithm to retrieve the `species` attribute of `Monkey` objects whenever it is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your file `monkey_classif.py`, add a function `compute_knn(dataframe, k=5)`. **Read Part #4 carefully beforehand!**\n",
    "  1. We'll consider that monkey datapoints are represented on a 2D plane, where the x-axis corresponds to the BMI, and the y-axis corresponds to the fur color.\n",
    "  1. In your `utils.py` file, you will find a function `euclidean_distance`, which takes the coordinates of two points and returns their Euclidean distance. Use that function to compute the Eucledian distance between points. As a reminder, in the 2D plane, the Euclidean distance between points $p=\\langle p_x, p_y \\rangle$ and $q=\\langle q_x, q_y \\rangle$ is given by: $$d(p,q)=\\sqrt{(p_x - q_x)^2 + (p_y - q_y)^2}$$.\n",
    "  1. Add a test for `euclidean_distance` in `tests.py`. Make sure your code passes **all** your tests.\n",
    "  1. Separate the monkeys into two groups: those which have an empty `str` for their `species` attribute, and those which do not.\n",
    "  1. Classify each monkey `m` in the first group (which have an empty `str` for their `species` attribute):\n",
    "     1. compute the Euclidean distance of `m` to all monkeys in the second group (which don't have an empty `str` for their `species` attribute), using the `euclidean_distance` function \n",
    "     1. retrieve the species attributes of the `k` monkeys which are the nearest to the monkey `m` you're currently classifying\n",
    "     1. assign the most frequent species among the `k` nearest neighbors as the species of monkey `m`(or ponder the importance based on the inverse of the distance, depending on the variant of the algorithm you wish to implement)\n",
    "     1. optionnally (depending on the variant of the algorithm you wish to implement), add monkey `m` to the second group of monkeys (corresponding to those which have a non-empty species attribute)\n",
    "  1. Update the dataframe column `species`. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Have a look at the tests we have provided for the KNN classification function in `tests.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewrite your function to use a functional programming style. **Read Part #3 carefully beforehand!** All your code should be written without `if`,`for` or `while` keywords. Here's a breakdown of how you can do it to guide you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can start by separating monkeys based on whether they have an empty `species` attribute or not using `filter` statements.\n",
    "1. The core of the algorithm consists in removing monkeys one by one from the list of monkeys with empty `species`, and adding them to the list of monkeys with non-empty `species` attributes instead. This is equivalent to performing a `reduce ` over the first group (unspecied monkeys), using the second group (specied monkeys) as your initial value and accumulator.\n",
    "1. If you use this `reduce` pattern, you will need to define a function that classifies one monkey: it needs to take as arguments a) the current list of specied monkeys and b) the current unspecied monkey, and returns the list of specied monkeys (a), potentially with an added element corresponding to the now-specied monkey (b) depending on the variant of the algorithm you implement.\n",
    "1. Retrieving the $k$ nearest neighbors can be done using the `sorted` function, supplied with a sorting `key` based on Euclidean distance. \n",
    "1. To determine the most common species amongst neighbors, you might find [`collections.Counter.most_common()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter.most_common) to be helpful."

    "### Review #2.1: `pdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pdb` stands for [Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). It's a tool that comes shipped in with most Python installations. It allows you to run your code interactively, inspect the values of variables at a specific point of the execution process, and follow step-by-step what your code is actually doing. It's an extremely useful tool, that can help you fix and improve your code. We strongly encourage you to start using it. Even if it seems a bit daunting at first, being fluent with `pdb` will speed up your debugging a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Firing up the debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to start the debugger:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the terminal, instead of running `python my_script.py`, run `python -m pdb my_script.py`. This will start the debugger and halt for user input before executing your code.\n",
    "2. Within your script, add the line `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` wherever. When this line is encountered, this will start the debugger and halt for user input at the current step of the execution. **When using this solution, be careful to remove this instruction once you're done with debugging!**\n",
    "\n",
    "When halting for user input, the debugger gives you access to a full Python interactive interpreter, populated with the variables at the current point in the execution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** *If you're coding using Jupyter, do note that you would need a different tool, [`ipdb`](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/). We encourage you to use a proper IDE to handle complex, multi-file projects such as this one.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breakpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of the debugger is to add **breakpoints**. A breakpoint is a marker that tells the debugger where to pause execution and wait for user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `pdb`, you can set a breakpoint using `b` (or `break`), followed by a line number: e.g., typing `b 42` will halt execution whenever your code tries to execute the 42nd line of your code.\n",
    "- If you want to set a breakpoint on an instruction in a different file, you can type `b other_file.py:l`, where `other_file.py` is a path to the other python file you're targetting, and `l` is the line number in that file.\n",
    "- You can also use qualified function names to set breakpoints: `b my_module.MyClass.my_method` will halt execution whenever the method `my_method` of the class `MyClass` in the module `my_module` is called. \n",
    "- You can list all current breakpoints by typing `b`, without arguments. You can remove all existing breakpoints using `cl` (or `clear`), and you can remove one specific breakpoint by typing `cl B`, where `B` is the breakpoint number for the breakpoint you want to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Major commands\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many debugger commands. Here are a few useful ones, but we strongly encourage you to read through [the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands)\n",
    "- `n` or `next` performs the next instruction\n",
    "- `s` or `step` \"steps into\" the current instruction: if it's a function call, for instance, it will move the debugger to this function.\n",
    "- `w` or `where`prints a stack trace: it tells you what functions have indirectly called the function you're currently in.\n",
    "- `c` or `continue` just resumes the execution process, until you hit another breakpoint\n",
    "- `q` or `quit` quits the debugger and stops the execution process\n",
    "- `p` or `print` prints the value of the argument statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example run\n",
    "\n",

    "**Note that the exercises in this section  are entirely optional. This section of the lab is here to teach you how TDD works.** The idea is to give you an interactive apporach to TDD and unit-test that you can apply to your monkey classification KNN later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’re going to write and debug a set of utility functions to convert to and from Roman numerals. \n",
    "Mechanics of constructing and validating Roman numerals can be seen in [“Case study: roman numerals”](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/regular-expressions.html#romannumerals).\n",
    "In the following, such mechanisms are recalled and usually provided, you only need to focus on writing tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that: in Roman numerals, there are seven characters that are repeated and combined in various ways to represent numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I = 1\n",
    "* V = 5\n",
    "* X = 10\n",
    "* L = 50\n",
    "* C = 100\n",
    "* D = 500\n",
    "* M = 1000 \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some general rules for constructing Roman numerals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes characters are additive. I is 1, II is 2, and III is 3. VI is 6 (literally, “5 and 1”), VII is 7, and VIII is 8.\n",
    "* The tens characters (I, X, C, and M) can be repeated up to three times. At 4, you need to subtract from the next highest fives character. You can't represent 4 as IIII; instead, it is represented as IV (“1 less than 5”). 40 is written as XL (“10 less than 50”), 41 as XLI, 42 as XLII, 43 as XLIII, and then 44 as XLIV (“10 less than 50, then 1 less than 5”).\n",
    "* Sometimes characters are… the opposite of additive. By putting certain characters before others, you subtract from the final value. For example, at 9, you need to subtract from the next highest tens character: 8 is VIII, but 9 is IX (“1 less than 10”), not VIIII (since the I character can not be repeated four times). 90 is XC, 900 is CM.\n",
    "* The fives characters can not be repeated. 10 is always represented as X, never as VV. 100 is always C, never LL.\n",
    "* Roman numerals are read left to right, so the order of characters matters very much. DC is 600; CD is a completely different number (400, “100 less than 500”). CI is 101; IC is not even a valid Roman numeral (because you can't subtract 1 directly from 100; you would need to write it as XCIX, “10 less than 100, then 1 less than 10”). \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for Roman numerals lead to a number of interesting observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is only one correct way to represent a particular number as a Roman numeral.\n",
    "2. The converse is also true: if a string of characters is a valid Roman numeral, it represents only one number (that is, it can only be interpreted one way).\n",
    "3. There is a limited range of numbers that can be expressed as Roman numerals, specifically 1 through 3999. The Romans did have several ways of expressing larger numbers, for instance by having a bar over a numeral to represent that its normal value should be multiplied by 1000. For the purposes of this chapter, let’s stipulate that Roman numerals go from 1 to 3999.\n",
    "4. There is no way to represent 0 in Roman numerals.\n",
    "5. There is no way to represent negative numbers in Roman numerals.\n",
    "6. There is no way to represent fractions or non-integer numbers in Roman numerals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start mapping out what our code should do. It will have two main functions, ``to_roman()`` and ``from_roman()``. The ``to_roman()`` function should take an integer from 1 to 3999 and return the Roman numeral representation as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop right there. Now let’s do something a little unexpected: write a test case that checks whether the ``to_roman()`` function does what you want it to. You read that right: you’re going to write code that tests code that you haven’t written yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **test-driven development**, or TDD. The set of two conversion functions — ``to_roman()``, and later ``from_roman()`` — can be written and tested as a unit, separate from any larger program that imports them. Python has a framework for unit testing, the appropriately-named ``unittest`` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing is an important part of an overall testing-centric development strategy. If you write unit tests, it is important to write them early and to keep them updated as code and requirements change. Many people advocate writing tests before they write the code they’re testing, and that’s the style we're going to adopt in this lab. But unit tests are beneficial no matter when you write them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before writing code, writing unit tests forces you to detail your requirements in a useful fashion.\n",
    "* While writing code, unit tests keep you from over-coding. When all the test cases pass, the function is complete.\n",
    "* When refactoring code, they can help prove that the new version behaves the same way as the old version.\n",
    "* When maintaining code, having tests will help you cover your ass when someone comes screaming that your latest change broke their old code. (“But sir, all the unit tests passed when I checked it in...”)\n",
    "* When writing code in a team, having a comprehensive test suite dramatically decreases the chances that your code will break someone else’s code, because you can run their unit tests first. (I’ve seen this sort of thing in code sprints. A team breaks up the assignment, everybody takes the specs for their task, writes unit tests for it, then shares their unit tests with the rest of the team. That way, nobody goes off too far into developing code that doesn’t play well with others.) "

    "1. To write a test case, first we need to subclass the ``TestCase`` class of the unittest module. This class provides many useful methods which you can use in your test case to test specific conditions.\n",
    "2. ``known_values`` consists in a tuple of integer/numeral pairs that you verified manually. It can include the lowest ten numbers, the highest number, every number that translates to a single-character Roman numeral, and a random sampling of other valid numbers. You don’t need to test every possible input, but you should try to test all the obvious edge cases.\n",
    "3. Every individual test is its own method. A test method takes no parameters, returns no value, and must have a name beginning with the four letters test. If a test method exits normally without raising an exception, the test is considered passed; if the method raises an exception, the test is considered failed.\n",
    "4. Here you should call the actual ``to_roman()`` function for every known value. (Well, the function hasn’t been written yet, but once it is, this is the line that will call it.) Notice that you have now defined the API for the ``to_roman()`` function: it must take an integer (the number to convert) and return a string (the Roman numeral representation). If the API is different than that, this test is considered failed. Also notice that you are not trapping any exceptions when you call ``to_roman()``. This is intentional. ``to_roman()`` shouldn’t raise an exception when you call it with valid input, and these input values are all valid. If ``to_roman()`` raises an exception, this test is considered failed.\n",
    "5. Assuming the ``to_roman()`` function was defined correctly, called correctly, completed successfully, and returned a value, the last step for every known value is to check whether it returned the right value. This is a common question, and the ``TestCase`` class provides a method, ``assertEqual``, to check whether two values are equal. If the result returned from ``to_roman()`` does not match the known value you were expecting (numeral), ``assertEqual`` will raise an exception and the test will fail. If the two values are equal, ``assertEqual`` will do nothing. If every value returned from ``to_roman()`` matches the known value you expect, ``assertEqual`` never raises an exception, so ``test_to_roman_known_values`` eventually exits normally, which means ``to_roman()`` has passed this test. \n",
    "6. Once you have a test case, you can start coding the ``to_roman()`` function. First, you should stub it out as an empty function and make sure the tests fail. If the tests succeed before you’ve written any code, your tests aren’t testing your code at all! Unit testing is a dance: tests lead, code follows. Write a test that fails, then code until it passes. At this stage, you want to define the API of the ``to_roman()`` function, but you don’t want to code it yet. (Your test needs to fail first.) To stub it out, use the Python reserved word ``pass``, which does precisely nothing. "

    "Now that the ``from_roman()`` function works properly with good input, it's time to fit in the last piece of the puzzle: making it work properly with bad input. That means finding a way to look at a string and determine if it's a valid Roman numeral. This is inherently more difficult than validating numeric input in the ``to_roman()`` function, but you have a powerful tool at your disposal: regular expressions. (If you’re not familiar with regular expressions, now would be a good time to learn about them.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several simple rules for constructing a Roman numeral, using the letters M, D, C, L, X, V, and I. Let's review the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes characters are additive. I is 1, II is 2, and III is 3. VI is 6 (literally, “5 and 1”), VII is 7, and VIII is 8.\n",
    "* The tens characters (I, X, C, and M) can be repeated up to three times. At 4, you need to subtract from the next highest fives character. You can't represent 4 as IIII; instead, it is represented as IV (“1 less than 5”). 40 is written as XL (“10 less than 50”), 41 as XLI, 42 as XLII, 43 as XLIII, and then 44 as XLIV (“10 less than 50, then 1 less than 5”).\n",
    "* Sometimes characters are... the opposite of additive. By putting certain characters before others, you subtract from the final value. For example, at 9, you need to subtract from the next highest tens character: 8 is VIII, but 9 is IX (“1 less than 10”), not VIIII (since the I character can not be repeated four times). 90 is XC, 900 is CM.\n",
    "* The fives characters can not be repeated. 10 is always represented as X, never as VV. 100 is always C, never LL.\n",
    "* Roman numerals are read left to right, so the order of characters matters very much. DC is 600; CD is a completely different number (400, “100 less than 500”). CI is 101; IC is not even a valid Roman numeral (because you can't subtract 1 directly from 100; you would need to write it as XCIX, “10 less than 100, then 1 less than 10”). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, one useful test would be to ensure that the ``from_roman()`` function should fail when you pass it a string with too many repeated numerals. How many is “too many” depends on the numeral. \n",

    "One aspect of Python we've somewhat skimmed over thus far concerns functional programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like object-oriented programming, FP is a programming paradigm, i.e., a programming \"style\" which requires you to structure your code in a certain way. If OOP can be roughly defined as \"everything is just objects with attributes and method\", FP can be thought of as \"all the code is just functions of data\". As such, FP style code tends to use specific functions such as `map` and`reduce`, tries to avoid `for`, `if`, and other syntactic words, and tries to describe the full process as a series of calls.\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "def lower_first_char(arg_str):\n",
    "    \"\"\"A silly function that takes the first character, lowers it, and returns it.\"\"\"\n",

    "lower_first_char(\"CHIMPS!\") # returns \"c\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, writing a function can be undesirable at times, expecially when you're dealing with very trivial pieces of codes that don't really warrant giving potential users of your code access to them. Enter lambdas!\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "f = lambda s: s[0].lower()\n",
    "f(\"CHIMPS!\") # returns \"c\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example here is strictly equivalent to our earlier `lower_first_char` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lambda (or lambda function) is a statement that produces a callable. They are identified by the syntactic word `lambda`. Anything appearing between that `lambda` and the colon `:` correspond to arguments. Anything after the colon corresponds to what a call to the lambda will return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas have many use cases. For instance, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    ">>> l = [\n",
    "...     \"    Space\", \"\\tmonkey\", \" in  \", \"the\", \"\\t\\tplace \", \" to\", \"  be\",\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda here allows us to sort our elements \"properly\", instead of being misguided by the existence of whitespace around our items. On the other hand, assuming we only really need this pre-processing for sorting, it would be overkill to define a function for that.\n",

    "### Review #3.3: generators and the `itertools` library\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to an important point: all the functional API in python is designed around **generators**. Generators are ordered sequences over which you can iterate only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating generator\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways of constructing generators. The first one consists in function definitions containing the `yield` syntactic word:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def my_gen(...):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    yield something\n",
    "    \n",
    "g = my_gen(...) # creates the generator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the `yield` keyword is used will correspond to another element in the generator. Therefore, to convert a list in a generator, one may write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def list_to_gen(some_list):\n",
    "    for elem in some_list:\n",
    "        yield elem\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way is to use a comprehension with parentheses (rounded brackets):\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "my_gen = (func(item) for item in seq if test(item))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why generators?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main interest of generators is that they are iterable sequences, but they have low memory footprint: once you've processed one element, that element is discared and not stored in memory. Assuming you have to deal with a very large sequence, using generators will help you avoid memory errors and the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another crucial point with generators is that they're not evaluated unless explicitly required. This means that you potentially write more efficient programs, as computations that are not necessary will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explicitely evaluate a generator, you can either user the `next` function, or use a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "g = some_generator(...)\n",
    "elem = next(g) # will evaluate the first element in the generator \n",
    "for elem in g:\n",
    "    # will evaluate all elements in the generator, one by one\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `itertools`: a generator-based library for iterable sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "The python standard library `itertools` contains many function for merging, duplicating and manipulating generators (or sequences in general). Have a look at it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html): it contains many very useful functions that can save you a lot of time."

    "### Review #3.4: `filter`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter` function allows you to drop items from a sequence based on a `test` callable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the following are roughly equivalent:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# 1. using a for-loop\n",
    "filtered = []\n",
    "for item in sequence:\n",
    "    if test(item):\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, `filter` also accepts the `None` object instead of a `test` callable. In that case, it will drop all `falsy` items:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, this means that `reduce` can serve in a great number of situations. Here are some examples:\n",

    ">>> functools.reduce(lambda a,b: a + [b], nums, ['a', 'b', 'c']) # extends ['a', 'b', 'c'] with nums\n",

    ">>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> functools.reduce(lambda acc, el: 10*acc + el, nums, 0) # converts list of digits to integer\n",
    "12345\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While `reduce` used to be a default function available without import, it has been moved to the `functools` standard library. It remains one of the most important concepts in functionnal programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In functional programming languages, the analog of `reduce` is often called `fold`.\n",
